# About
The code in this repository is an implementation of the framework "Neuroevolution of Artificial General Intelligence" and is part of my 2020 Master's Thesis project at the University of Oslo. It is part of the [SOCRATES](https://github.com/SocratesNFR/) project, and any further updates and development on the implementation will be done in a fork of this repository, which can be found at https://github.com/SocratesNFR/neat-nagi-python.
